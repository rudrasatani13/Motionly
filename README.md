# Motionly

> **Move Better.**

Motionly is a PWA-first, privacy-first AI fitness coach foundation. The MVP roadmap targets browser-based real-time movement coaching using on-device pose estimation in later phases.

---

## Current Status

- **Phase 1 — Development Environment Setup:** complete.
- **Phase 2 — PWA Foundation (Vite + React + TypeScript):** complete.
- **Phase 3 — Git Repository & Branching Strategy Setup:** complete.
- **Phase 4 — Project Folder Structure & Architecture Standards:** complete.
- **Phase 5 — Design System Foundation: Tokens & Theme:** complete.
- **Phase 6 — Routing Architecture Setup:** complete.
- **Phase 7 — Wireframing & User Flow Documentation:** complete (docs only; no app screens were built).
- **Phase 8 — Core UI Component Library (Primitives):** complete. Reusable primitives (`Button`, `Input`, `Text`/`Heading`, `Card`, `Divider`, `Spacer`, `Row`, `Column`, `Badge`, `Tag`, `Chip`, `Icon`, `Avatar`) live under `src/components/primitives/` and are documented in [`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](./docs/COMPONENTS.md). No product screens, data-backed UI, or fake stats were introduced.
- **Phase 9 — Core UI Component Library (Feedback & Status):** complete. Reusable feedback / status / progress components (`CircularProgress`, `LinearProgress`, `ScoreBadge`, `FormCueCard`, `RepCounter`, `WorkoutTimer`, `ToastProvider` / `useToast`, `SkeletonLoader`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorBoundary`, `ConfidenceIndicator`) live under `src/components/feedback/`. They compose the Phase 8 primitives, are token-coded via `@utils/score`, honor `prefers-reduced-motion`, and are documented in [`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](./docs/COMPONENTS.md) §8. No product screens, no real workouts, no real ML outputs, no real camera, no fake users / workouts / stats / AI feedback / scores / reps / timers / confidence / streaks / subscriptions / analytics were introduced.
- **Phase 10 — Splash & App Launch Experience:** complete. An inline pre-React HTML splash paints in `index.html` on a dark `#0A0A0F` canvas; a React `<LaunchScreen>` (Framer Motion scale + fade, reduced-motion aware) takes over after hydration; `<LaunchGate>` + `useLaunchDecision` (in `src/launch/`) hold the launch screen for ~1.8s while the real local `hasOnboarded` reader (`src/platform/onboarding-storage.ts`) and a future-safe `getLaunchAuthState()` placeholder resolve, then release `<AppRouter>` on the canonical pathname. A `useServiceWorkerUpdatePrompt` hook (`src/components/launch/`) listens for the existing `motionly:sw` `update-available` event and surfaces a Phase 9 toast with a `Refresh` action — no auto reload. `ShowToastInput` gained an optional `action` field as a minimal Phase 9 extension. Real Supabase auth, real session rehydration, cameras, ML, payments, and analytics are still intentionally deferred to their later phases.
- **Phase 11 — Onboarding Flow: Screens 1–3:** complete. `zustand` is installed for the first in-memory onboarding draft store (`src/store/useOnboardingStore.ts`), with stable domain types in `src/types/onboarding.ts`. `/welcome` is now a real mobile-first onboarding entry page, and `/onboarding` renders the first three internal steps: welcome, multi-select goals, and single-select fitness level. The flow includes five-dot progress, back navigation, selection persistence while moving through the in-memory flow, and Framer Motion step transitions that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. The later onboarding completion work is described in Phase 12 below.
- **Phase 12 — Onboarding Flow: Screens 4–5 (Limitations & Camera Tutorial):** complete. `/onboarding` now renders all five screens: welcome, goals, fitness level, movement limitations (multi-select chips for lower back, knees, shoulders, hips, ankles, wrists, none, plus an optional ≤120-character "anything else" note with safety copy), and a camera tutorial / permission primer (3-step setup walkthrough with Framer Motion entrance, reduced-motion aware). A new `src/platform/camera-permission.ts` adapter is the only Phase 12 caller of `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`; it requests **video only**, stops every track immediately after permission resolves, returns a typed `granted | denied | unavailable | error` result, and never keeps a stream, frame, or preview alive. `src/platform/onboarding-storage.ts` gained a write path (`completeOnboardingStorage`) that creates the IndexedDB store on demand and persists `hasOnboarded = true` alongside a minimal completion record (timestamp, goals, fitness level, limitations, optional notes, whether camera was granted). On the camera step the primary CTA is user-initiated, has a loading state while the browser prompt resolves, navigates to Home `/` on grant, and offers an honest "Continue without camera for now" path for denial / unavailable / error states that still completes onboarding locally without pretending the camera was granted. **No fake users, sessions, workouts, stats, AI feedback, scores, streaks, subscriptions, or analytics were added; Supabase sync is intentionally skipped until backend/auth phases land; no live camera preview, no skeleton overlay, and no ML are implemented.**
- **Phase 13 — Home / Dashboard Screen:** complete. The Home `/` route now renders an honest, mobile-first dashboard for returning users. It reads the real Phase 12 onboarding completion record from IndexedDB, shows local onboarding summary data when available, and keeps workout library, history, stats, and subscription areas in honest empty / unavailable states until those systems exist.
- **Phase 14 — Workout Library Screen:** complete. `/workouts` now renders the real Motionly browsing surface — a Workouts tab with filter chips (All, Beginner, Intermediate, Quick ≤15min, Strength, Mobility) over a small canonical MVP catalog, an Exercises tab with debounced search and muscle/difficulty filters, and an in-page exercise quick-detail panel that previews step-by-step instructions, future coaching cues, and a camera-placement summary without launching the camera. Locked Pro cards stay visible behind a lock badge and route to the existing `/paywall` placeholder with an honest toast — Phase 14 does not implement real subscription state. The dashboard's Today's Workout, Quick Start, and Explore Workouts CTAs all open this real library. **No fake user history, no fake stats/ratings/calories/popularity, no live coaching, no camera or ML, no Supabase, no auth, no real payments, no active workout flow were added.**

### Honest scope note

This repository is an early-stage foundation. The following are **planned for later phases of [`MOTIONLY_MASTER_PLAN.md`](./MOTIONLY_MASTER_PLAN.md) and do NOT exist yet**:

- Live camera preview, silhouette setup, and pose detection (Phase 16+)
- On-device pose estimation, skeleton overlay, form scoring
- Real-time AI coaching, voice cues, rep counting
- Workout plans, adaptive difficulty, workout history
- Authentication, user accounts, profiles
- Supabase backend, sync, history, analytics
- Subscriptions, paywall, free-tier enforcement
- Settings UI, accessibility audit, i18n

Phase 6 introduced React Router 6 and a routing skeleton: every planned route was wired with an honest placeholder page that named the route, URL pattern, and future implementation phase. Later phases now replace those placeholders incrementally. There is **no fake user state, no fake workouts, no fake stats, no fake AI feedback, and no fake subscription state anywhere in the repo.** Protected routes are wrapped in a structural-only `<RequireAuth>` guard; real authentication is still deferred to Phase 32.

Phase 7 added UX planning documentation only — wireframes for every planned screen, user-flow narratives, and Mermaid diagrams of the five key journeys. Wireframes live in [`docs/wireframes/`](./docs/wireframes/) and user-flow narratives in [`docs/USER_FLOWS.md`](./docs/USER_FLOWS.md). **No runtime app code changed in Phase 7.** Sample names and numbers in the wireframes are clearly labeled illustrative documentation and must not be pasted into product code as if real workouts, users, or stats existed.

Phase 8 added Motionly's primitive UI library under `src/components/primitives/` plus a tiny `triggerLightHaptic()` adapter in `src/platform/haptics.ts` (the chokepoint the `Button` uses instead of touching `navigator.vibrate` directly). The full primitive inventory, accessibility rules, and the list of components previously deferred to Phase 9 (`CircularProgress`, `LinearProgress`, `ScoreBadge`, `FormCueCard`, `RepCounter`, `WorkoutTimer`, `Toast`, `SkeletonLoader`, `EmptyState`, `ErrorBoundary`, `ConfidenceIndicator`) are documented in [`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](./docs/COMPONENTS.md). The primitives are presentational only — no real app screens, data-backed UI, or fake users / workouts / stats / AI feedback ship in this phase.

Phase 9 added the feedback / status / progress component library under `src/components/feedback/` plus the `@utils/score` (`clampScore`, `scoreTone`) and `@utils/formatDuration` helpers. `framer-motion` was added as a production dependency for the score-ring sweep, cue-card slide / fade, rep-counter pulse, toast and confidence-banner transitions — all gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`. The toast system (`ToastProvider`, `ToastViewport`, `useToast`) is an **in-house Motionly queue**; no `react-hot-toast` or similar third-party dependency was added, and Phase 44 Web Push notifications remain unimplemented. Every feedback component is presentational — none of them generate scores, reps, timers, cues, confidence readings, toasts, or empty-state copy on their own. The future engines / stores supply real values; if the caller has nothing real to render, the component is omitted.

Phase 10 added Motionly's launch experience. The inline pre-React splash in `index.html` paints the dark `#0A0A0F` canvas + wordmark + tagline before any JS / CSS bundle resolves, so there is no white flash on any system theme. The React `<LaunchScreen>` under `src/components/launch/` takes over on the same canvas with a Framer Motion `0.9 → 1.0` scale + fade on the wordmark and a delayed tagline fade — both gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`. `<LaunchGate>` (in `src/launch/`) holds the launch screen for ≈ 1.8 seconds while `useLaunchDecision` resolves `readHasOnboarded()` from `src/platform/onboarding-storage.ts` and the future-safe `getLaunchAuthState()` placeholder, then reconciles bare `/` to `/welcome` only when no real local onboarding flag exists. Direct deep links into Phase 6 placeholders remain testable. The Phase 9 toast system gained an optional `action` field on `ShowToastInput`; the new `useServiceWorkerUpdatePrompt` hook listens for the existing `motionly:sw` `update-available` event and surfaces "Refresh to use the latest version." with a `Refresh` action that only reloads on user input. **No fake users, fake sessions, fake tokens, fake `hasOnboarded` writes, fake camera, fake ML, fake workouts, fake stats, fake AI feedback, fake subscriptions, or fake analytics were introduced.** Real Supabase auth (Phase 32) and the real cross-feature IndexedDB schema (Phase 30) are still deferred.

Phase 11 added the first half of onboarding. `/welcome` now introduces Motionly honestly with a primary "Get Started" CTA to `/onboarding` and a secondary sign-in link to the still-placeholder `/login` route. `/onboarding` remains a single route with internal step state for the first three screens from the wireframe: welcome, goal selection, and fitness level. The Zustand store is intentionally local and in-memory only: selections persist when moving back and forward inside the flow, but a full browser refresh may reset them. Step 3 does not write `hasOnboarded`, does not navigate home, and does not fake completion; it shows a Phase 12 handoff for limitations and the camera tutorial.

Phase 12 completed onboarding. `/onboarding` now renders all five screens with five-dot progress that lights up step-by-step. Screen 4 (Limitations) is a multi-select chip list (lower back, knees, shoulders, hips, ankles, wrists, none) with mutually-exclusive "None" semantics handled in the store and an optional ≤120-character free-text note carrying a clear safety message — Motionly is a coach, not medical care. Screen 5 (Camera Tutorial) is a 3-step setup primer rendered as cards with subtle Framer Motion entrance animations gated by `prefers-reduced-motion`; it does **not** request camera permission until the user taps the primary CTA. `src/platform/camera-permission.ts` is the single chokepoint that calls `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ video: true })`, stops every track immediately after permission resolves, and returns a typed `granted | denied | unavailable | error` result — no stream, frame, preview, or recording leaves the adapter. `src/platform/onboarding-storage.ts` gained a write path (`completeOnboardingStorage`) that creates the IndexedDB schema on demand and persists `hasOnboarded = true` alongside a minimal completion record (timestamp, goals, fitness level, limitations, optional notes, whether camera was granted). After a granted prompt — or an honest "Continue without camera for now" exit on denial / unavailable / error — the page writes the flag and navigates to Home `/`. On a fresh launch the LaunchGate now routes returning users past `/welcome` because the real flag exists. Supabase sync is intentionally skipped until backend/auth phases land. No fake users, sessions, workouts, stats, AI feedback, scores, streaks, subscriptions, or analytics were added; the camera platform code never stores or uploads video.

## Testing the PWA

> Service workers and PWA install prompts only run against the **production build**, not the dev server (`devOptions.enabled: false` in `vite.config.ts`).

```bash
pnpm build && pnpm preview
```

Then open http://localhost:4173/ and check DevTools → Application → Manifest and Service Workers. See `docs/SETUP.md` §15–§18 for the full PWA / offline test procedure.

## Repository Standards

This repository follows lightweight conventions documented in **[`docs/REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md`](./docs/REPOSITORY_STANDARDS.md)**:

- **Conventional Commits** (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, …)
- **Current workflow:** solo developer working directly on `main`. Commits are kept small, scoped to one phase, and checked locally with `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` (a Husky pre-commit hook enforces these), and `pnpm build` before pushing.
- **Future workflow** (from the master plan, adopted when collaboration or staging deployment requires it):
  - `main` — production releases
  - `develop` — integration / staging
  - `feature/phase-XX-description` — phase-scoped work
  - `fix/issue-description` — bug fixes
  - PR reviews + branch protection on `main` once CI exists

A practical PR template lives at [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and will activate once contributors start opening pull requests on GitHub.

## Architecture & Coding Standards

Phase 4 added the scalable folder structure and standards that everything else builds on. Phase 5 added the design-system foundation:

- **[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** — folder layout, layering rules, the platform-adapter pattern, privacy architecture, and a checklist for adding new features.
- **[`docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md`](./docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md)** — TypeScript, React, hook, service, ML, styling, naming, and import rules.
- **[`docs/COMPONENTS.md`](./docs/COMPONENTS.md)** — Phase 8 primitive component library: what each primitive is for, accessibility rules, light/dark expectations, and what is deferred to Phase 9.
- **[`docs/wireframes/`](./docs/wireframes/)** — Phase 7 low-fidelity UX blueprints for every planned screen plus a Mermaid `flow-diagrams.md`.
- **[`docs/USER_FLOWS.md`](./docs/USER_FLOWS.md)** — Phase 7 narratives for the five critical user journeys (first-time, returning, subscription conversion, permission failure, low-confidence AI).
- **[`tailwind.config.ts`](./tailwind.config.ts)** — Motionly brand colors, neutral scale, font stack, and typography utilities.

Lint and format are wired up via ESLint + Prettier and enforced by a Husky pre-commit hook (`pnpm format:check && pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck`). Run `pnpm lint` / `pnpm format` manually whenever you want.

The `src/` folders created in Phase 4 are populated only when their phase arrives. As of Phase 14, `src/theme/` holds the design-system foundation, `src/router/` holds the route table / guards / layouts / lazy loading, `src/pages/` holds route pages including onboarding, the dashboard, and the real Workout Library, `src/hooks/` adds typed navigation, dashboard data reads, and the `useDebouncedValue` helper used by the library search input, `src/store/` holds the onboarding draft store, `src/types/` holds onboarding, dashboard, and workout-library domain types, `src/data/workout-library.ts` holds the canonical static MVP catalog of workouts and exercises (real product content, not user data), `src/components/primitives/` holds the Phase 8 primitive UI library, `src/components/feedback/` holds the Phase 9 feedback / status / progress library, `src/components/onboarding/` holds onboarding screen components, `src/components/dashboard/` holds Phase 13 dashboard composites, `src/components/workout-library/` holds the Phase 14 library composites (header, tab switcher, filter chips, workout & exercise cards, locked-content badge, empty state, exercise quick-detail panel), `src/components/routing/` holds the Phase 6 routing-infrastructure components, `src/platform/haptics.ts` is the first platform adapter (vibration), `src/platform/onboarding-storage.ts` holds the minimal local onboarding persistence adapter, `src/utils/cn.ts` is the shared `clsx` wrapper, `src/utils/score.ts` defines the canonical 0–100 clamp + `scoreTone` helper, `src/utils/formatDuration.ts` formats clock-style durations, and `src/utils/workout-library.ts` holds the pure filter/search/sort helpers for the library. Workout history, real workout sessions, camera setup, ML, authentication, payments, and later product systems are still deferred to their later phases.

---

## Privacy & Product Principle

Motionly is designed so that **no raw video ever leaves the device**. All future pose estimation, form analysis, and coaching logic is intended to run on-device in the browser. Network calls in later phases are expected to carry only derived signals (rep counts, form scores, anonymous analytics where opted in) — never camera frames or video.

This principle constrains architectural decisions in every later phase and should not be compromised for convenience.

---

## Master Plan

The single source of truth for scope, ordering, and deliverables across all phases is **[`MOTIONLY_MASTER_PLAN.md`](./MOTIONLY_MASTER_PLAN.md)**. Read the relevant phase before making changes; do not implement features outside the current phase's scope.
